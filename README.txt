pymba
=======

pymba is a Python wrapper for the Allied Vision Technologies (AVT) Vimba C API. It wraps the VimbaC.dll file included in the AVT Vimba installation to provide a simple Python interface for AVT cameras. It currently supports most of the functionality provided by VimbaC.dll.

Installation
============

* Install the Vimba SDK from AVT to the default directory.

* Run the AVTDriverInstaller tool and install the AVT Vimba SDK drivers.

* Install pymba.

Usage
=====

Testing installation
--------------------

If Vimba SDK and pymba are installed correctly, then the following code should give the installed Vimba version. No camera is needed.

	from vimba import *
	
	vimba = Vimba()
	print vimba.getVersion()
	
Interacting with cameras
------------------------

Discover, open, manipulate, and capture frames from a camera.
    
    from vimba import *
    import time
    
    # start Vimba
    vimba = Vimba()
    vimba.startup()
    
    # get system object
    system = vimba.getSystem()
    
    # list available cameras (after enabling discovery for GigE cameras)
    if system.GeVTLIsPresent:
        system.runFeatureCommand("GeVDiscoveryAllOnce")
        time.sleep(0.2)
    cameraIds = vimba.getCameraIds()
    for cameraId in cameraIds:
        print 'Camera ID:', cameraId
    
    # get and open a camera
    camera0 = vimba.getCamera(cameraIds[0])
    camera0.openCamera()
    
    # list camera features
    cameraFeatureNames = camera0.getFeatureNames()
    for name in cameraFeatureNames:
        print 'Camera feature:', name
    
    # get the value of a feature
    print camera0.AcquisitionMode
    
    # set the value of a feature
    camera0.AcquisitionMode = 'SingleFrame'
    
    # create new frames for the camera
    frame0 = camera0.getFrame()    # creates a frame
    frame1 = camera0.getFrame()    # creates a second frame
    
    # announce frame
    frame0.announceFrame()
    
    # capture a camera image
    camera0.startCapture()
    frame0.queueFrameCapture()
    camera0.runFeatureCommand('AcquisitionStart')
    camera0.runFeatureCommand('AcquisitionStop')
    frame0.waitFrameCapture()
    
    # get image data...
    imgData = frame0.getBufferByteData()
    
    # ...or use NumPy for fast image display (for use with OpenCV, etc)
    import numpy as np
    moreUsefulImgData = np.ndarray(buffer = frame0.getBufferByteData(),
                                   dtype = np.uint8,
                                   shape = (frame0.height,
                                            frame0.width,
                                            1))
    
    # clean up after capture
    camera0.endCapture()
    camera0.revokeAllFrames()
    
    # close camera
    camera0.closeCamera()
    
    # shutdown Vimba
    vimba.shutdown()
	
Interacting with the Vimba system
---------------------------------
    
Get a reference to the Vimba system object and list available system features.
    
    from vimba import *
    
    # get system object
    system = vimba.getSystem()
    
    # list system features
    for featureName in system.getFeatureNames():
        print 'System feature:', featureName
        
	# shutdown Vimba
    vimba.shutdown()

Interacting with transport layer interfaces
-------------------------------------------
    
Get a reference to an interface object and list available interface features.
    
    from vimba import *
    
    # get list of available interfaces
    interfaceIds = vimba.getInterfaceIds()
    for interfaceId in interfaceIds:
        print 'Interface ID:', interfaceId
    
    # get interface object and open it
    interface0 = vimba.getInterface(interfaceIds[0])
    interface0.openInterface()
    
    # list interface features
    interfaceFeatureNames = interface0.getFeatureNames()
    for name in interfaceFeatureNames:
        print 'Interface feature:', name
    
    # close interface
    interface0.closeInterface()

Handling Vimba exceptions
-------------------------

	from vimba import *

	try:
		vimba = Vimba()
		vimba.startup()
	except VimbaException as e:
		print e.message

Known issues
============

* Not all API functions are wrapped (most are). For full list see vimbadll.py.
* Only 32-bit VimbaC.dll (version 1.2.1) under Windows has been tested.
* Colour cameras and GigE cameras have not been tested.
* The VimbaC.dll file location has been hardcoded in vimbadll.py. It should be easy to change if needed.
